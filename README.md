# Dietio

## is all about simplifying

***

### Project Idea

Diet is simple, managing it is not.
Sometimes costs get over the top, other times opening the same *.pdf* file over and over can become tedious and other
times you miss days.
The main idea behind this project is to simplify the diet management and the costs associated with it.
**Dietio** will provide an interface where to set up your diet info and the web-app will take care of the rest. Giving
the user insights and statistics and a responsive GUI.

### To locally run

### No-IDE

1- install python 3x https://realpython.com/installing-python/

2- setup a virtual environment

    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv "name as you like"
    source env/bin/activate

3- install django

    pip install django

4- clone the repo

    git clone git@gitlab.inf.unibz.it:FrancescoPio.Spiri/wie_cs07.git

5- install the project dependencies (none for now)

    pip install -r requirement.txt

6- make a demo project just to copy the SECRET KEY generated by Django

    django-admin startproject name_of_the_project

7- now go to the setting.py and copy the SECRET_KEY

8- navigate to the cloned folder and open the setting.py and paste the copied SECRET_KEY

9- make the migrations and create the superuser

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser

10- last thing to do is running the server via:

    python manage.py runserver

you can now reach the project in

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/

***

### Using PyCharm

1- Open the cloned repo in PyCharm

2- Wait for PyCharm to download all the dependencies, then run these scripts in the PyCharm internal terminal to:
make the migrations, create a superuser and finally start the server

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    python manage.py runserver

2.5 - if the following error pops up
> Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?

run:

    pip install django
    pip install django-autocomplete-light
    pip install djangorestframework

then run point 2 again

3- once the server is up you can reach the locally hosted project in:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/
