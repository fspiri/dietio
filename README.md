## How to run locally

<details markdown="1">
<summary><h3> From PyCharm/WebStorm or other IDEs </h3></summary>

1. Open the cloned repo in the IDE
2. Wait for the IDE to build the project, then run these scripts in the IDE's internal terminal
   
    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    * The superuser will grant you admin access to the service. Same values will then be used to log-in.

9. go to the subfolder `settings.py` and paste the key as value for `SECRET_KEY`
10. make the migrations and create a superuser, that would be a local admin for you to navigate the website

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
11. Now run the server with `python manage.py runserver`
