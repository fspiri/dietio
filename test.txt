Dear host family,

I am Francesco Pio Spiri, a 21 years old student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Bozen.

I am a reliable, careful sensible and responsible person and I can adapt to most circumstances with no particular difficulties. I listen more than I speak. I love nature in all ways down to the maths that rule it. I'm fascinated by new experiences. I love learning about anything new I come in contact with.
In my free time I like doing sport, drawing, reading and programming as a hobby too.
I used to play guitar too but free time became shorter and shorter.
I can cook and can teach some Italian dishes as well as learn about traditional dishes.

I had to take care of my little sister for most of my childhood and spent quite some time with my younger cousins so I have some experience with children, but I will surely listen and pay big attention to all your advices. 
I like working with children because I like teaching them my skills or helping them with theirs, giving my point of view and being a role model for them.

Im looking forward to become your au-pair because im very excited to be able to know your culture, your language and if you're interested share mine with u.
As of now I'm not able to fluently speak German but learning it, is my number one priority. 
I can fluently speak English and Italian (my university is mostly taught in English)

Hope to hear from you soon.

Francesco.
