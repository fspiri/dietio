    <h1> About the project</h1>
    <h3> Project_name_to_be_decided</h3>
    <p>
        is an idea born by a real necessity or better curiosity, that is, gathering statistics about my diet. From
        automating basic tasks like knowing precisely how much I was spending per week to more advanced statistics like
        knowing the total nutritional values intake. I'm shooting at the moon with this full-stack project but I will
        try to merge the skills I'm learning as best as I can.
