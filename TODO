DONE - search a way by which the string content can be retrieved:
    -> language swap options

Now that i have a reliable way by which to extract info from the input boxes, i should find a way to arrange them into a JSON file.
    the data structure for now is like.
    They should be decided based on the active table.
    for active_table_n all the data should be grouped into a single chunk.
    What's the best way to do so?

{ 'table' : 'table_0', 'food_name': 'example_name', 'food_quantity': '0', 'food_calories' : '0', 'food_proteins': '0', 'food_cost': '0' }
            breakfast    name                         quantity              calories                proteins            cost

    To create:
    - Count how many rows a table has.
    - Then count and divide data in chunks of 5, assigning 0 to data that's null.
    - Then divide on multiple of five based on how many rows there are in tables.
    - Convert data into JSON format as before.

    js function to help with JSON conversion:
        - data to JSON: stringify(); better yet: toJSON();
        - JSON to data: parse();


TODO 10-5
    DONE - Gather data from all rows of nested tables - start: 10.23, finish:11.25
    - convert data into object adn then into JSON - start:11.40, finish: 12.00
    - the moment of creating REST APIs has come

2 - should each user input their statistics?
    PROS
        allows automatic diet formation
        more personalization
    CONS
        slower and more difficult profile-creation process

Now that
